 1. Create a string constant called firstName and initialize it to your first name. Also, create a string constant called lastName and initialize it to your last name.
 2. Create a string constant called fullName by adding the firstName and lastName constants together, separated by a space.
 3. Using interpolation, create a string constant called myDetails that uses the fullName constant to create a string introducing yourself. For example, my string would read: "Hello, my name is Matt Galloway.".*/
