 1. Create a constant named range and set it equal to a range starting at 1 and ending with 10 inclusive. Write a for loop that iterates over this range and prints the square of each number.
 2. Write a for loop to iterate over the same range as in the exercise above and print the square root of each number. Youâ€™ll need to type convert your loop constant.

let range = 1...10
var squared = 0

/*
 3. Above, you saw a for loop that iterated over only the even rows like so:

 Change this to use a where clause on the first for loop to skip even rows instead of using continue. Check that the sum is 448, as in the initial example.
